3. UI_IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Scrollable containers for large grids
   - Format-specific loading messages
   - Clear error handling
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Dynamic font sizing based on grid width

4. GIT_MANAGEMENT:
   - Exclude node_modules
   - Ignore package-lock.json
   - Include start/stop scripts
   - Maintain build info
   - Regular deployments to Heroku

[DEPENDENCIES]
PYTHON:
- Flask
- Pillow
