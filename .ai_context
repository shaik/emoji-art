[CORE_PURPOSE]
A web application that creates art using emojis as pixels. The app processes images and replaces regions with emojis that best match the color of that region.

[ARCHITECTURE]
BACKEND:
- Flask server (app.py)
- RESTful endpoints for image processing
- CSV-based emoji database with color mappings
- Image processing using PIL
- Debug mode support

FRONTEND:
- Single page application
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Real-time grid preview
- Responsive design
- Debug toggle functionality
- Multi-format download support

[KEY_COMPONENTS]
1. Emoji Database:
   - Located in `/emojiDB/`
   - Uses Unicode emoji test file (`emoji-test.txt`) as source
   - Generates `emoji_data.csv` with unique-colored emojis
   - Color calculation focuses on central area of emojis using weighted median
   - Filters out duplicate colors, keeping only first emoji for each unique color
   - Currently uses 1,038 emojis with distinct colors

2. Web Interface:
   - Frontend in `/static/`
   - Uses JavaScript for image processing
   - Converts uploaded images into emoji art

3. app.py:
   - Main Flask application
   - Image processing logic
   - Route handlers
   - External connections enabled

4. utils/csv_parser.py:
   - Emoji data parsing
   - Row validation
   - Non-ASCII character support
   - Error handling

5. static/js/main.js:
   - File handling
   - Grid rendering
   - Color averaging
   - Emoji mapping
   - Debug utilities
   - Canvas-based image generation
   - Multi-format download handling

6. static/css/styles.css:
   - Modern pastel theme
   - Responsive design
   - Grid-based layouts
   - Dynamic font sizing
   - Mobile optimization
   - Scrollable containers for large grids

   - Loading indicators during generation

[DESIGN_DECISIONS]
1. EMOJI_VALIDATION:
   - Removed Unicode range limitations
   - Accept all non-ASCII characters
   - Return detailed error messages
   - Tuple response format (is_valid, message)

2. DOWNLOAD_HANDLING:
   - Canvas-based image generation
   - Shared rendering logic for PNG/JPEG
   - Quality settings for JPEG (0.8)
   - Format-specific file extensions
   - Asynchronous processing with loading states

3. UI_IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Scrollable containers for large grids
   - Format-specific loading messages
   - Clear error handling
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Dynamic font sizing based on grid width

4. GIT_MANAGEMENT:
   - Exclude node_modules
   - Ignore package-lock.json
   - Include start/stop scripts
   - Maintain build info
   - Regular deployments to Heroku

[DEPENDENCIES]
PYTHON:
- Flask
- Pillow
- pytest

NODE:
